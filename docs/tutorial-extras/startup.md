Lets See how to Configure Tapper Desktop Application to Start


## Tapper App Startup

![](https://github.com/tapper-app/assets/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-01-26%20at%205.42.03%E2%80%AFAM.png?raw=true)

When you start the Application you maybe see the bottom circles in a red color thats mean the tools are not installed on your environment
or not configured yet in tapper

To Configure the Environment you need to open the App Settings and Add the Required Paths in App Settings Page and Wait Until the Circles Colors Changed to Green

To Make Tapper Work All of them Should be in a Green Color

After Adding the Environment Variables You will See all of them Changed except Device Connection and this will work only when you Connect a Device or Start an Emulator

## Note

The Environment Variables Can be Diff depends on the way that you installed the Tools so please follow internet guide on how to install npm, node, adb depends on your os or package manager
